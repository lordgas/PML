Read the training dataset
```{r}
ibrary(RCurl)
x <- getURL("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
trainingSet <- read.csv(text = x)

x <- getURL("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")
testingSet <- read.csv(text = x)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
